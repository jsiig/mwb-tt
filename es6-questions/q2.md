# Question 2: Write a function to check if a word/phrase/sequence is a palindrome using vanilla JS.

```js
const isPalindrome = phrase => {
  // Type check - let's not deal with anything but the following JS types: numbers, strings
  // (even though an array can *technically* be a palindrome, too - not sure how we would assess that?
  // Each array element as character palindrome? Or each character in each array element?)

  // Let's pretend this is a third party library that is super strict about this, so let's throw a TypeError.
  // I'd usually do a simple early return at this point in most cases (but not to false as that'd 
  // indicate a negative response, causing potential errors)
  if (!['string', 'number'].includes(typeof phrase)) {
    throw new TypeError('A palindrome must be either a string or a number')
  }

  // First, we cast to string if type is number using interpolation in ES6+ template string 
  // (could also do a typecheck for Number + .toString(), 
  // however this seems a more appropriate way for this particular function),
  // remove any whitespace present, then split on character to array for easy data manipulation.
  // Technically the .trim() is redundant, as the .replace() with regex should handle that already.
  const phraseArray = `${phrase}`.trim().replace(/\s+/g, '').split('')

  // Early return (undefined) in case of empty or all whitespace input
  if (!phraseArray.length) return

  // Sentences can have special characters in them, and still be counted as palindromes.
  // Custom case to ignore those characters - we want to be able to detect all cases.
  const phraseArraySentence = phraseArray.filter(character => character.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/))

  // Going forwards in array, check if the corresponding character coming back from the other end is equal.
  const arrayPalindromeCheck = ary => ary.every((character, index) => ary[ary.length - index - 1]  === character)

  // Return true if either kind of palindrome returns true
  // Both are required as a palindrome OF special characters is still a palindrome, 
  // and a sentence with special characters still counts if the special characters don't always line up
  return arrayPalindromeCheck(phraseArray) || arrayPalindromeCheck(phraseArraySentence)
}
